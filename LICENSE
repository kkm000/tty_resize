End of BSD 3-Clause License.

This section between horizontal lines is not part of a legally-binding license.

The original DEC license (ODECL) of this program repeats language of the BSD
3-Clause license nearly verbatim. The explicit non-endorsement clause in the
ODECL, equivalent to the Clause 3 of the BSD license, restricted choices of
a modern OSS license, and the BSD-3-Clause license appears to be the most
compatible with the ODECL.
Take all this with a grain of salt. IANAL, and this comment doesn't constitute
a legal advice or opinion.

The original DEC license follows.
